# Whale Docker

This is the Docker Compose configuration for the ordering system for BAID's Whale Cafe.

## Get Started

The Docker Compose configuration is intended to be run in production. For development, please check [WebArtistryBAID](https://github.com/WebArtistryBAID)/[**whale-backend**](https://github.com/WebArtistryBAID/whale-backend) and [WebArtistryBAID](https://github.com/WebArtistryBAID)/[**whale-frontend**](https://github.com/WebArtistryBAID/whale-frontend).

* Clone this repository.
* Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
* Move `.env.example` to `.env` and add your database credentials, JWT secret key, public hosting base URL, and authorization secrets accordingly.
* In the `frontend` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. You should not change the contents of `.env` within the `frontend` directory.
* Run `docker-compose up -d`.
* You're ready to start! Create an account at `/nc/`, and add a data source with hostname `db`, database name `whale`, along with your credentials to use the dashboard.
